    <p>We're building the best chat app on Earth</p>
    <p>Chat today is broken. We have 5-10+ different chat apps on our phones, each for a different
      set of contacts. There's no unified inbox or search. Our inbox is cluttered with one-time
      codes and spam.</p>
    <p>So, we're fixing it. Beeper is a universal chat app. It's a single app to chat with friends
      on 15 different chat networks. We've added chat superpowers that make it the best chat app on
      earth.</p>
    <p>Apple, Facebook and Google control the majority of chat apps right now. For them, chat is
      just a minor part of their main business. Their chat apps exist primarily to lock people in to
      their advertising or hardware walled-gardens.</p>
    <p>Our approach is different. Chat is our only business. We love chat and are 100% dedicated to
      making it awesome. Read more of our chat manifesto.</p>
